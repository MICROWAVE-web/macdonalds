<br>
<br><strong>9. THIRD-PARTY CONTENT
<br></strong>We may provide information about third-party products, services, activities or events, or we may allow third parties to make their content and information available on or through the Services (collectively, “Third-Party Content”). We provide Third-Party Content as a service to those interested in such content. Your dealings or correspondence with third parties and your use of or interaction with any Third-Party Content are solely between you and the third party. Panda does not control or endorse, and makes no representations or warranties regarding, any Third-Party Content, and your access to and use of such Third-Party Content is at your own risk.
<br>
<br><strong>10. INDEMNIFICATION
<br></strong>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Panda and our subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of our respective officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (individually and collectively, the “Panda Parties”) from and against any losses, liabilities, claims, demands, damages, expenses or costs (“Claims”) arising out of or related to (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your User Content or Feedback; (c) your violation of these Terms; (d) your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights); or (e) your conduct in connection with the Services. You agree to promptly notify Panda Parties of any third-party Claims, cooperate with Panda Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including attorneys' fees). You also agree that the Panda Parties will have control of the defense or settlement, at Panda's sole option, of any third-party Claims. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and Panda or the other Panda Parties.
<br>
<br><strong>11. DISCLAIMERS
<br></strong>Your use of our Services is at your sole risk. Except as otherwise provided in writing by us, our Services and any content therein are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.

<br>
<br><strong>12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
<br></strong>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Panda and the other Panda Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive or special damages or lost profits, even if Panda or the other Panda Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br>
<br>The limitations set forth in this Section 12 will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct of Panda or the other Panda Parties or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.
<br>
<br><strong>13. RELEASE
<br></strong>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release Panda and the other Panda Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”
<br>
<br><strong>14. TRANSFER AND PROCESSING DATA
<br></strong>In order for us to provide our Services, you agree that we may process, transfer and store information about you in the United States and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.
<br>
<br>15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION
<br>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND PANDA CAN BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER. THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND PANDA TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. THIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRING A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY CONCERNING ANY DISPUTE THAT MAY ARISE WHICH IS COVERED BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND ARE INSTEAD AGREEING TO SUBMIT ANY SUCH DISPUTE SOLELY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF TO AN IMPARTIAL ARBITRATOR.
<br>
<br><strong>15.1 Agreement to Arbitrate
<br></strong>
<br>You and Panda mutually agree to forego the delay and expense of using a court of law and choose instead to benefit from impartial dispute resolution procedure of using binding arbitration for any “Covered Claims” (as defined below) that arise between you and Panda, and/or any current or former employee, officer, or director of Panda sued for acts or omissions taken in the capacity of Panda’s agent, representative or employee. You and Panda agree that this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and will survive even after these Terms terminate. Any revision to or termination of these Terms that modify or terminate this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver shall not apply to an arbitration pending at the time of the revision, except as may be required by applicable law.
<br>
<br><strong>15.2 Claims Subject to Arbitration
<br></strong>
<br>Other than the exceptions in the “Excluded Claims” Section below, the “Covered Claims” include any and all controversies, disputes, disagreements, and claims arising out of, or relating to, these Terms (including its enforcement, breach, performance, interpretation, validity, or termination), or your access to and/or use of the Services, or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Site to the fullest extent allowed by law, including but not limited to such controversies, disputes, disagreements, and claims that pre-date your agreement to these Terms.
<br>
<br><strong>15.3 Excluded Claims
<br></strong>
<br>15.3.1 The Covered Claims do not include (and thus shall not require arbitration of) the following types of claims that will hereafter be referred to as “Excluded Claims”: (a) any claims that cannot be required to be arbitrated as a matter of California law subject to federal preemption (including claims or charges that must be filed with a governmental administrative agency); (b) applications for provisional remedies, preliminary injunctions, and temporary restraining orders, including but not limited to those relating to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; and (c) small claims actions demanding $10,000 or less brought on an individual basis and within a small claims court’s jurisdiction. 
<br>
<br>15.3.2 In the event you or Panda choose to pursue arbitration of both Covered Claims and Excluded Claims and the other party objects, the Covered Claims must be arbitrated. In no event will Covered Claims be joined with Excluded Claims and litigated in court unless both parties agree to waive arbitration.
<br>
<br><strong>15.4 Class Action Waiver and Jury Waiver
<br></strong>
<br>You and Panda agree to arbitrate any Covered Claims only on an individual basis and hereby waive any right to bring, participate in, or receive money or any other relief from any representative, class, or collective proceeding (“Class Action Waiver”). No party may bring a claim on behalf of other individuals, and no arbitrator hearing any claim under these Terms may: (a) without the consent of all parties, combine more than one individual’s claim or claims into a single case; (b) order, require, participate in, or facilitate production of class-wide contact information or notification of others of potential claims; or (c) arbitrate any form of a class, collective, or representative proceeding. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial (“Jury Trial Waiver”). This Jury Trial Waiver shall not apply, and shall be severed from this Agreement, if it is not permissible under applicable laws or otherwise found to be unenforceable, including presently California.
<br>
<br><strong>15.5 Arbitrability Determinations
<br></strong>
<br>If a party violates the agreement to arbitrate by commencing an action asserting a Covered Claim in a court of law, then the court (and not an arbitrator) shall have the authority to resolve any disputes about the interpretation, formation, existence, enforceability, validity, and scope of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver. If a party complies with the agreement to arbitrate and files for arbitration without filing a complaint in a court of law, then the arbitrator shall have the authority to resolve any disputes about the interpretation of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver for purposes of discovery or the merits of the underlying claim, but shall have no authority to resolve any disputes about the formation, existence, enforceability, or validity of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, including the Class Action Waiver.
<br>
<br><strong>15.6 Arbitration Rules, Procedures, and Costs
<br></strong>
<br>For any Covered Claim that you have against Panda, or Panda has against you, the claiming party may, voluntarily and at its election, contact the other party and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of the claim (“Notice”). If such Notice is being sent to Panda, it shall be sent by email at GuestCare@pandarg.com or by certified mail addressed to:
<br>
<br>Attn: Corporate Legal Team
<br>Panda Restaurant Group, Inc.
<br>1683 Walnut Grove Avenue
<br>Rosemead, CA 91770
<br>
<br>If the Notice is being sent to a party other than Panda, it shall be sent to the last known (by the claiming party) email or street address of the other party. The Notice should (a) include the claiming party’s name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Covered Claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Each party agrees to attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute. If you and Panda cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Covered Claim, then the party desiring to pursue a legal dispute must prepare a written demand setting forth the claim(s) and deliver the written demand within the applicable statute of limitations period by hand or first class mail to the address above. You and Panda agree that the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree within thirty (30) days after names of potential arbitrators have been proposed, then by a single arbitrator who is chosen by AAA. The arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA under its rules and procedures (provided such location is reasonably convenient to you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed to by you and Panda. Except to the extent that they are modified by the rules below, if you are an individual person, the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules that are in effect at the time of the filing of the demand will apply.
<br>
<br>15.6.1 The parties agree that the applicable AAA rules are modified as follows:
<br>
<br>15.6.2 Any arbitrator must be neutral as to all parties. Standards for the recusal of an arbitrator shall be the same standards under which trial judges are recused under California law.
<br>
<br>15.6.3 No party is entitled to its attorneys’ fees, except as may be awarded in a matter authorized by and consistent with applicable law.
<br>
<br>15.6.4 All discovery shall be subject to any and all objections available under FRCP 26(b). Each party shall avoid broad or widespread collection, search, and production of documents, including electronically stored information (“ESI”). If a compelling need is demonstrated by the requesting party, the production shall: (i) be narrowly tailored in scope; (ii) only come from sources that are reasonably accessible without undue burden or cost; and (iii) be produced in a searchable format, if possible without undue burden or cost, and which is usable by the receiving party and convenient and economical for the producing party. Where the costs and burdens of the requested discovery outweigh its likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, the arbitrator shall deny such requests or order production on condition that the requesting party advance to the producing party the reasonable costs involved in making the production, subject to the allocation of costs in the final award.
<br>
<br>15.6.5 The arbitrator shall have the authority to award the same damages and other relief that would have been available in court pursuant to the law governing the Covered Claim(s).
<br>
<br>15.6.6 Either party shall have the right to file motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment/adjudication.
<br>
<br>15.6.7 The arbitrator shall have the authority to issue an award or partial award without conducting a hearing on the grounds that there is no claim on which relief can be granted or that there is no genuine issue of material fact to resolve at a hearing.
<br>
<br>15.6.8 The Federal Rules of Evidence shall apply to all arbitration proceedings.
<br>
<br>15.6.9 For discovery purposes only, an arbitrator may consolidate claims filed by multiple individuals, each on their own behalf, in a single arbitration proceeding, or may conduct a joint hearing for efficiency purposes, so long as the arbitrator does not (a) certify (conditionally or otherwise) a collective, class, or representative action that includes individuals who have not themselves already submitted their own individual claims, or (b) authorize the issuance of notice of the arbitration to individuals on the grounds that the arbitrator or any party believes there are other individuals who are similarly situated to or share commonality with a party to the arbitration.
<br>
<br>15.6.10 The arbitrator must issue a decision in writing, setting forth in summary form the reasons for the arbitrator’s determination and the legal basis therefor.
<br>
<br>15.6.11 The arbitrator’s authority shall be limited to deciding the case submitted by the parties to the arbitration. Therefore, no decision by any arbitrator shall serve as precedent in other arbitrations except to preclude the same claim from being re-arbitrated between the same parties.
<br>
<br>15.6.12 The parties may settle any dispute on a mutual basis without involvement of the arbitrator.
<br>
<br>15.6.13 If you initiate arbitration, you will pay the first $250, and Panda will pay all other filing, administrative, or hearing fees. If Panda initiates arbitration, Panda will pay all filing, administrative, and hearing fees. Regardless of which party initiates arbitration, you will remain responsible for your attorneys’ fees and costs unless the law governing the Covered Claim provides for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs and the arbitrator determines as part of the arbitration award that you may recover a certain amount of attorneys’ fees and costs.
<br>
<br>15.6.14 A party may make an offer of judgment in a manner consistent with, and within the time limitations, consequences, and effects provided in Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The offer shall be served on the offeree in the same manner in which other papers are served in the arbitral proceeding. The offer shall not be served on the arbitrator, except that if the offer is accepted, either party may then file with the arbitrator the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service thereof. The arbitrator shall then immediately render an award as provided by the offer, and the arbitration proceedings shall then be terminated. If the offer is not accepted, the offer shall not be used as evidence in the arbitration proceedings and, following the issuance of the arbitrator’s award, the offeror may file a motion for costs with the arbitrator, who shall retain jurisdiction to decide the motion and award costs to the offeror as warranted.
<br>
<br>15.7 Mass Arbitration (inapplicable in California and in any other jurisdiction where this term is prohibited by law).
<br>
<br>A “Mass Arbitration” shall be defined as any one of the following: (i) the same lawyer or law firm, alone or with other lawyers or law firms, files or causes to be filed 30 or more Covered Claims within a thirty-day period; (ii) the same lawyer or law firm, alone or with other lawyers or law firms, files or causes to be filed 50 or more Covered Claims within a sixty-day period; (iii) the same lawyer or law firm, alone or with other lawyers or law firms, serves as counsel (regardless of whether the lawyer or law firm is counsel of record) for 30 or more persons who file a Covered Claim within a thirty-day period; or (iv) the same lawyer or law firm, alone or with other lawyers or law firms, serves as counsel (regardless of whether the lawyer or law firm is counsel of record) for 50 or more persons who file a Covered Claim within a sixty-day period. In the event of a Mass Arbitration, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 15.6.13. above, Panda shall (i) not be required to advance or pay arbitration costs for any arbitration and (ii) may be awarded its reasonable attorney fees, expert fees, and costs if it prevails (without having to show that your claim was frivolous or in bad faith) if such recovery is authorized under applicable law. The immediately preceding sentence shall apply only to those arbitrations that are filed once the definition of Mass Arbitration is met. Thus, by way of example, if the same law firm files 35 Covered Claims within a thirty-day period, the first 29 Covered Claims shall be governed by subpart Section 15.6.12 and the last six Covered Claims (i.e., arbitration numbers 30 through 35) shall be governed by this Section 15.7. Once a law firm or lawyer is deemed part of a Mass Arbitration, all Covered Claims he/she/it files, assists in filing, or causes to be filed shall be governed by this Section 15.7 unless and until the law firm or lawyer does not file, assists in filing, or causes to be filed any Covered Claims for a period of one year. This section 15.7 is inapplicable in California and in any other jurisdiction where this term is prohibited by law.
<br>
<br><strong>15.8 Severability
<br></strong>
<br>If any term or condition in this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is determined to be unenforceable or in conflict with a mandatory provision of applicable law, it shall be construed to incorporate any mandatory provision, or the unenforceable or conflicting term or condition shall be automatically severed and the remainder of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver shall not be affected.
<br>
<br><strong>16. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE
<br></strong>Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of California, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

<br>
<br><strong>19. SEVERABILITY
<br></strong>If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
<br>
<br><strong>20. MISCELLANEOUS

The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Use of the word “including” will be interpreted to mean “including without limitation.” Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
