                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Panda Restaurant Group, Inc., was built on a foundation of diversity, equity and inclusion. When first generation immigrants Andrew and Peggy Cherng opened the original Panda Inn in 1973, they did so with the commitment of achieving the American Dream for themselves and their extended family of Associates.
<br>
<br>Today, our Company proudly employs associates in over 2,000 company-owned stores, and across several restaurant concepts, including Panda Express, Panda Inn, &amp; Hibachi-San. We respect and appreciate our Associates’ varied journeys in life, including however they wish to identify, as well as their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and ideas. By embracing and uplifting our Associates at every level, we will not only meet their needs, but also the needs of our communities.
<br>
<br>In 2013, we established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council and selected our first Chief Diversity Officer to continue elevating the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion in our business. The Council is comprised of Support Center and Operations ambassadors who are challenged to solicit feedback, share insights and champion actions that drive inclusion and engagement efforts reflecting the diversity of our guests, associates and communities.
<br>
<br>At Panda Restaurant Group, Inc., we will achieve our vision of becoming a world leader in people development by fostering an environment of inclusion and belonging, creating a workplace where opportunity and growth are not only possible but achievable.</p>
